```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is a markdown file

Now I am just randomly typing anything that comes to my mind for example  
**Japanese Bento** and ***sushi set*** that I just have.  

Besides that, I got to say KFC is a real hunger killer because it offers a seaseonal deal of 9 pieces for ***5.99 pounds ***!  

```{r}
chicken_deal = 5.99
10 * chicken_deal

```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
